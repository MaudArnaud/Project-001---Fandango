# Project-001---Fandango

Project Scope¶
State goal / Problem statement
Back in 2015, FiveThirtyEight published an article entitled "Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandango’s". The article concluded that Fandango tends to overrate thier movies. In other words, the number of stars that the website shows for a certain movie is often higher than the true rating for the same movie.

Our goal in this notebook is to validate these results through a detailed EDA for the given data set.

To that end, the Analysis consists of two main parts:

Exploring Fandango Displayed Scores versus True User Ratings
Comparison of Fandango Ratings to Other Sites
The data used is this note book is publicly available on github. It has been uploaded to the current working folder.

What are the required analytical steps?
As a first step, we will observe the different data:

what we have
data types
missing values
duplicate
irrelevant observations
need of reformatting
outliers and what we will do with it
As a second step, if necessary, we will clean the data accordingly to the observations made previously.

As a third step, we will start comparing the Fandango displayed stars and true user ratings.

As a fourth and final step, we will compare Fandango ratings to the other websites that we have at hand.
